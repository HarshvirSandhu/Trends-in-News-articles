Unlike the West, where extended Christmas holidays end only after January 1, many offices in Indore were open for regular hours yesterday.So, thesleepy, glassy-eyed, and pretty hung-over employees struggled to get through the day. We spoke to the working wonders, who pulled off a ‘present’ on their attendance cards yesterday and how! planning an excuse in advance helps Pankaj Pardeshi, who knew that such a situation will arise on Jan 1, had already informed his boss about reaching office late. He says, “I already knew that everyone would be hung-over after partying till late on December 31. Since my office doesn’t give the day off on January 1, I knew it would be difficult to get a leave for the day. So, I informed my boss fifteen days in advance that I will come late as I have to attend the wedding of a relative, which I can’t avoid.”From funeral to water crisis, koi bhi bahana chalega Arpit Sharma, who works in Indore and belongs to Sagar, says, “There was a holiday on January 1 in my office but due to some reason, it got cancelled. Till that time I had already made plans to celebrate New Year’s so I could not drop them. Anyway, after partying till late, somehow I managed to reach office in time but I could not take bath. When my boss asked the reason behind reaching office in a shabby state, I said there was no water in my PG so I could not bathe.” Amam Jain, a working professional, also shares a similar experience. He says, “I was also asked about looking exhausted and tacky in office. So I just said that I was coming from somebody’s funeral. Since I had to come to office on time, I directly came here. After this, my manager asked me to go home and take a bath (laughs).”The age-old ‘vehicle broke down, boss!’  Diksha Agrawal, an IT professional, says, “Though I wasn’t hung-over or anything when I reached office, I got pretty late. So when my boss asked me the reason, I said my scooty’s tyres got deflated and there was no one around to help me out. I told him I got it fixed and then came to office.” Rohan Singh, who works at a supermarket, says, “When I reached late yesterday after partying the night before, my manager asked me to explain. I said I lost my vehicle’s key at the party last night, so today morning I went there with my friend to look for the keys, and came directly to office. To my wonder, he bought this excuse (winks).”Forgot my gaadi ke papers, got caught by the traffic police If nothing else works, this excuse comes in handy for coming late to office. Archit Datta, who works in an insurance company, says, “Getting scolded for coming late to office, that too on the first day of the year, is not a good idea. So when I reached late, before my boss could ask anything, I went to him myself and told him that I was caught by the traffic police as they were doing their regular checking and I forgot my vehicle papers at home, so I got late.”"
1,Bengali school in Kolkata with 3 students fears closure,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengali-school-in-kolkata-with-3-students-fears-closure/articleshow/45721422.cms,1,"KOLKATA: The once-vibrant South Suburban Branch School on Lansdowne Road, a Bengali medium government-sponsored school, has only three students. The students, one in Class VI and two in Class VII, are taught by seven teachers. The alma mater of late Supreme Court judge, Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee, the 80-year-old school faces imminent closure unless door-to-door campaign by its teachers to draw more students from the school’s neighbourhood yields results.If thestate government’s policy for schools with fewer students than teachers is implemented, the school will close doors or merge with another school. Education department’s district inspector of schools for Kolkata Debojyoti Boral said as much. “All government, government-sponsored and aided schools with a lopsided student-teacher ratio will be closed and merged with other schools,” he said without mentioning the school. Education minister Partha Chatterjee said he needed to update himself on the school from his officials now that he learnt about its low student count. However, education department sources said the school had already been included in the list of schools to be merged or closed. Officially, the school is open to students from classes V to XII, offering Science, Commerce and Humanities at the plus two level. It is affiliated to Madhyamik board and the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council. Seven teachers, including teacher-in-charge (TIC) Biswanath Bhattacharya diligently cater to their charges from 11am to 4.30pm. History teacher Bhairab Sardar, whom TOI observed entering the school at 10.45am all the way from Basirhat, said he and other teachers make it on time every day. He said they are very keen to teach but are pained by the empty benches in their classrooms. English teacher Surabhi Sen Chanda said the school was functioning well in the initial years of her stint here in 2003. ” she said. Class VII student Ganesh Basu, said he was happy to study here with all the personal attention he gets from seven teachers. Bhattacharya said, “The student count stood at 1,400-1,500 till the 70s. Even in 2007 we had 200 students. The rapid decline in numbers started since then. I and my teachers use our time outside the classroom going around in the school’s neighbourhood and asking parents to send their wards to our school. Some parents said they would do so from the next session.”"

3,Top 3 benefits of swearing in office,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/work/top-3-benefits-of-swearing-in-office/articleshow/13668619.cms,1,"You’re thinking, ‘You’re $%&*ing kidding me, right?’ Well, we aren’t. Not only is swearing in office OK, it might even help “boost your career”, and there’s research to back the claim.According to Jeffrey Cohn, a CEO succession-planning expert, “Companies increasingly prefer authentic leaders. Using colourful language can play to your advantage – as long as you also demonstrate empathy and good business judgment.” Cohn’s not the only one extolling the advantages of the F-bombs and the A-dashes – other studies have shown that cursing not only shows your great, ahem, leadership skills, it has several other advantages.So, what are they, and what do they mean for Delhi, the land of the MCs and BCs and the undisputed cussing capital?Benefit 1: leadership skills Cohn’s study was prompted by an ad featuring Michael Dubin, founder of an e-commerce start-up, who brags about how their razor blades are ‘f***ing great’ in a video that went viral. But wait, is Cohn’s theory that insane? Think Gordan Ramsay and Donald Trump, who’re not just known for their red-faced aggressiveness, but also their colourful language. Think back to 2004, when US vice prez Dick Cheney told a senator to go “f*** himself.” His unapologetic stance (he said “it was the best thing” he’d ever done) won him many compliments. Post the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, when Barack Obama told news anchor Matt Lauer that he was talking to experts “so I know whose a** to kick,” Forbes magazine said his use of the particular term “helped to curb criticism that he was not passionate enough in his reaction to the spill.” The Guardian also reported in 2006 that “36% of 308 UK senior managers and directors responded to a survey accepting swearing as part of workplace culture.” A 2005 study by Northern Illinois University asked 88 college students to evaluate two 5-minute speeches on the merits of lowering tuition fees – one that was PG, and the other with swear words. It concluded that “obscenity could impact credibility positively because it could make a speaker appear more human.”Benefit 2: Creates solidarity Apparently, cussing is the ultimate icebreaker. Ever heard of ‘social swearing’? It’s a term coined by UK’s Anglia University. A study by the university says that “swearing in the workplace builds camaraderie among workers and sometimes helps relieve stress”. When people swear, they often express honest, genuine feelings. The taboo language helps in maintaining solidarity and to cope with stress.Benefit 3: gender equality Harvard Business Review’s Anne Kreamer spoke about how cursing has given women a chance to penetrate male-dominated networks. A senior female attorney once told Kreamer, “Swearing gives men and women reciprocal permission to feel comfortable sharing revelations.” East Anglia’s study too, says “women tend to swear more in mixed company as a means of asserting themselves and preventing the conversation from being male-dominated.”Is it ok in Delhi offices? “Anything goes in my office,” says Rahul Arora*, a finance analyst in an IT firm, “When my boss gets pissed, he uses whatever abuses come to his mind.” For many, it’s the verbal equivalent of backslapping. Nitisha Bakshi*, 26, a lawyer, says bitching at work is common, although only in jest and rarely in front of the boss. “People call each other names jokingly, but it’s never a serious insult,” she says. For Pradeep Chopra*, 23, who works with a finance company, the Cohn study holds true to some extent. “I tend to get quite aggressive and throw around words like “screw that” and “what shit” (nothing too R-rated) in meetings, or if someone tries to act smart. My superiors often walk up to me later to compliment my confidence and decisiveness.” Savita Kumar*, 25, who works with an event management company, says her boss uses cuss words during motivational speeches. “It helps when my boss gets worked up, and asks us to go kick some a**” she says.-*Names changed on request"
